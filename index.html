    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        We have a long history, but here is the condensed version.  We are all basically "software developers".  There's four of us.  We are all U.S. based, and at one point we were all in Southen California.  
    </p>
    <p>
        We range in experience from 15 years to 25 years and over the courses of our careers we have all specialized in one or another aspect of software. We have a guy who is more of a network guy. Several web-developer types and a couple people who even know about hardware and electronics. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Why did we create this company?  Well, over the course of our careers we all came to the same basic conclusion. That we didn't want to work for other people and we wanted to do stuff "our way".  Our way is the right way.

    <h2>Our Services</h2>
    <div class="services">
        <div class="service-box">
            <h3>Websites</h3>
            <p>
                Can we make you a website?  Sure, but so can anyone else.  So can your friendly neighborhood robot.  What they can't offer you is decades of experience making websites and the insights we have all learned doing this for a living.  
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-box">
            <h3>Mobile Apps</h3>
            <p>
                We also do mobile apps.  We have made apps using many tools including native development for Android and Apple devices.  Need a Tablet app?  We can do those also.  Smartwatch? you got it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-box">
            <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>
                There's actually a lot more behind the scenes of both web and mobile apps than you may be aware of.  We've done it all.  We can tell you what you need, and help you implement it with a very clear no-nonsense approach.
